# Rope-Simulation
Verlet Integration for Rope Simulation in Unity using C#

**_It has an Option to Use a line Renderer to render the rope points or use a Mesh to render the line for a 3d Rope_**

Note that The **iterations** Parameter is crucial in terms of performance . Higher value for better simulation but results in a higher processing time 
Rope supports adding End anchor point and if left null , it would be ignored.

# Upcoming Updates 
* Support the attachment of objects or Rigidbodies along any or point on the rope other than the start or end.
* Imporved quality of mesh deformation
* More Performance optimizations
